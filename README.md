Code Repository for Analysis of NYPD Crime data

## Exploratory Analysis: 
Analysis was carried out on various factors such as:
- Crime rate in NYC boroughs
- Types of crimes
- Demographics of NYC
- Events in NYC
- Drug Analysis
- Time of crimes etc.

This folder also contains files where the data has been cleansed, transformed and modified with an intent of achieving appropriate exploratory data analysis.

## Predictive Analysis:
After careful feature engineering on independent variables, Principal Component Analysis was applied in order to retain only the most contributing factors. Feature scaling has been used to boost the model performance. 
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes 
- Decision Tree 

## Apriori Association:
This was carried out to find correlations between various types of crimes. The apriori algorithm helps in mining frequent item sets and the relevant association rules for the items (types of crimes in this case).
